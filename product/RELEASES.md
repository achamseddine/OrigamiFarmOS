# Releases

## v0.1.0 — Tablet MVP Prototype

First implementation pass following the AI Agent Build Prompt / Technical
Specifications v0.3 build order (design tokens → AppShell → 10 Option C
screens with mock data → local SQLite → core workflow writes → FastAPI
backend + PostgreSQL schema → sync skeleton → rule-based recommendation
engine → tests + docs).

**Delivered:**
- All 10 Option C screens (Flutter) + Animal Digital Twin detail screen, on-brand and data-driven.
- EN/AR + RTL support, offline-first local write pipeline for the core animal/task/feed workflows.
- FastAPI backend: every endpoint from tech spec §12, PostgreSQL schema + Alembic migrations (verified against real PostgreSQL 16), rule-based recommendation engine (6 rules, unit tested and wired to real seeded data), RBAC.
- 66 backend tests passing; mobile widget/unit tests written but unverified (no Flutter SDK in the build environment — see `mobile/flutter_app/README.md`).

See `backend/README.md` and `mobile/flutter_app/README.md` for the detailed
completion boundary, and `product/TRACEABILITY.md` for the requirement map.

**Next (tech spec milestones M4–M9):**
- Wire remaining dashboards (Milk/Egg/Produce/Sales trend panels) to the local SQLite repository layer instead of the static demo dataset.
- Network the sync queue to the backend's `/sync/push` / `/sync/pull` (currently simulated on-device).
- Mobile login/role-switching UI on top of the already-implemented backend RBAC.
- Pilot hardening: exports, onboarding, conflict-review UI.
